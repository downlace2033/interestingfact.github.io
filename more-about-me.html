        <h2>THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT ME THAT IS NOT ON MY RESUME</h2>
         </span></p>
        <p>
           I would say my involvement in charity has been a significant aspect of my life. Over the years I have had the opportunity to actively participate in running activities for charitable organizations which has genuinely been a fun experience. I have had the privilege of organizing different events connecting with people from all walks of life which has shown me how these small efforts change people’s lives. It stems out of a passion to give back to the community and I have found it rewarding because I am not just helping others but growing as a person too learning empathy, being more understanding of people’s situations, and always making compromises to make the right decisions. Seeing how small efforts lead to a change in people’s lives has fueled my desire to make a positive impact on any role I undertake be it uplifting others, or stepping up into a leadership role that would involve making decisions that would affect a large group of people. This continues to drive me, and it has always been something that I am willing to bring to any team I am part of.   </p>

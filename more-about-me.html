        <h2>THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT ME THAT IS NOT ON MY RESUME.</h2>
        <p>
            I would say my involvement in charity has been a significant aspect of my life. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to actively participate in running activities for charitable organizations, which has genuinely been a fun experience. I have had the privilege of organizing different events and connecting with people from all walks of life, which has shown me how these small efforts can change people’s lives. It stems from a passion to give back to the community, and I have found it rewarding because I am not just helping others but also growing as a person—learning empathy, being more understanding of people’s situations, and always making compromises to make the right decisions. Seeing how small efforts lead to a change in people’s lives has fueled my desire to make a positive impact in any role I undertake, whether uplifting others or stepping into a leadership role that involves making decisions affecting a large group of people. This continues to drive me, and it is something I am eager to bring to any team I am part of.
